# Duck_DB
This project explores the integration of DuckDB, a high-performance in-memory analytical database, with AI-driven techniques to simplify and accelerate modern data analysis. By combining DuckDB’s SQL capabilities with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and natural language query engines.
1.Key objectives:

Leverage DuckDB as a lightweight, serverless DBMS for analytics.

Enhance AI models with real-time retrieval mechanisms.

Enable natural language interaction with structured datasets.

2.Applications:

RAG-Enhanced AI Pipelines – Use DuckDB as a vector store to retrieve relevant context for LLMs.

Natural Language Querying – Convert plain English queries into SQL for fast, intuitive data exploration.


 Project Components

1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   - Store and search embeddings in DuckDB.
   - Improve AI response quality by grounding answers in retrieved data.

2. Natural Language Query Engine**
   - Accept user queries in natural language.
   - Automatically generate SQL, execute in DuckDB, and return results.
